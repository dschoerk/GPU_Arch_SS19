# GPU_Arch_SS19

Parallel implementations of a streaming minimum-maximum filter for
large datasets. Based on the algorithm proposed by Daniel Lemire in
the paper [Streaming maximum-minimum filter using nomore than three
comparisons per element](https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610046.pdf).

## Sources

Currently the project consist of the following sources:

### Streaming min/max algorithm interface

`streaming_min_max_algorithm_interface.h` defines the abstract class
`streaming_min_max_algorithm_interface` which defines the interface
which needs to be implemented to have a concrete implementation of the
*streaming min/max algorithm* properly integrate with the
[benchmarking framework](Streaming min/max benchmark framework)
(`streaming_min_max_comparison`) and the [collection of
algorithms](Streaming min/max algorithm collection)
(`streaming_min_max_algorithms`). The interface hereby consists of the
following (pure virtual) member functions:

#### `get_name()`

This function is intended to return the name of the streaming min/max
algorithm implementation. This name is used in the output of the
benchmarking framework.

    char const * get_name() const

#### `calc()`

This function is intended to do the main computation task of the
algorithm (including any memory allocation and data transfer between
CPU and GPU (and vice versa) if required by the algorithm). `array` is
hereby a vector of `float`s which serves as an input to the streaming
min/max algorithm. `width` is the width of the sliding window for the
min/max computation.

    void calc(std::vector<float> const & array,	unsigned int width)

#### `get_max_values()`

This function is intended to retrieve the maximum values computed by
the streaming min/max algorithm using the `calc()` function.

    std::vector<float> const & get_max_values() const
    
#### `get_min_values()`

This function is intended to retrieve the minimum values computed by
the streaming min/max algorithm using the `calc()` function.

    std::vector<float> const & get_min_values() const
	
### Streaming min/max algorithm collection

`streaming_min_max_algorithms.h` and
`streaming_min_max_algorithms.cpp` contain the and array of all
supported streaming min/max algorithms (`algorithms_array`) as well as
the number of supported algorithms `algorithms_array_size`.

    std::unique_ptr<streaming_min_max_algorithm_interface> algorithms_array[]
	
    const size_t algorithms_array_size

This array is used by the benchmarking framework to iterate over all
supported algorithms durign one benchmark run.

### Streaming min/max benchmark framework
	
`streaming_min_max_comparison.cpp` contains a simple benchmarking
framework which does the following things:

* handling of command line arguments (see [Running](#Running))
  - size of input vector (`sample_size`)
  - width of sliding window (`window_size`)
  - number of benchmarking iterations (`Ã¬terations`)
* creation of a input vector of `sample_size` random `float`values
* invocation of each algorithm's `calc()` function
* measurement of the run-time of each algorithm's `calc()` function

### Concrete streaming min/max algorithms

#### Lemire's implementation

The files `streaming_min_max_lemire.cpp` and
`streaming_min_max_lemire.h` provide [Lemire's
implementation](https://github.com/lemire/runningmaxmin) of the
algorithm. This implementation is a CPU-only implementation (i.e., the
GPU is *not* involved here).

#### Plain CUDA implementation

The files `streaming_min_max_cuda_plain.cpp`,
`streaming_min_max_cuda_plain_cuda.cu`,
`streaming_min_max_cuda_plain_cuda.cuh` and
`streaming_min_max_cuda_plain.h` currently provide a rather naive (and
thus inperformant) GPU implementation using plain
[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).

Hereby the files `streaming_min_max_cuda_plain_cuda.cu` and
`streaming_min_max_cuda_plain_cuda.cuh` contain the implementation of
the CUDA kernel and the CUDA-related CPU code (e.g., memory
allocation, memory transfer, kernel launch) whereas
`streaming_min_max_cuda_plain.cpp` and
`streaming_min_max_cuda_plain.h` contain the implementation of the
`streaming_min_max_algorithm_interface` interface for integrate with
the [benchmarking framework](Streaming min/max benchmark framework).

#### CUDA streams implementation

The files `streaming_min_max_cuda_streams.cpp` and
`streaming_min_max_cuda_streams.h` currently only provide provide the
implementation of the `streaming_min_max_algorithm_interface`
interface for integrate with the [benchmarking framework](Streaming
min/max benchmark framework). - The `calc()` function is currently
(almost) empty. At a later stage of the project the files are intended
to host a [CUDA
streams](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/gpu-pro-tip-cuda-7-streams-simplify-concurrency/)
based implementation of the streaming min/max algorithm.

#### Thrust implementation

The files `streaming_min_max_thrust.cpp` and
`streaming_min_max_thrust.h` currently only provide provide the
implementation of the `streaming_min_max_algorithm_interface`
interface for integrate with the [benchmarking framework](Streaming
min/max benchmark framework). - The `calc()` function is currently
(almost) empty. At a later stage of the project the files are intended
to host a [Thrust](https://developer.nvidia.com/thrust) based
implementation of the streaming min/max algorithm.

#### Utilities and helpers

The files `utils.cpp` and `utils.h` contains utility functions and
macros for error handling and console tracing.

## Building

Prior to building the executable, the variable `CUDA_PATH`needs to be
adjusted to match the path to the CUDA installation.

On a CUDA equipped machine the executable
`streaming_min_max_comparison` is built by invoking

    make -f Makefile_cuda

for a *release build* and

    make dbg=1 -f Makefile_cuda

for a *debug build*.

Debug builds keep all intermediate files (e.g., assembly and
pre-processed files), define the `DEBUG` macro, and include debug info
in the final executable by using the following command line switches
during compilation:

    -DDEBUG -g -G -save-temps

In addition to the default target (`all`), the following additional
`make` targets are supported:

* `clean` - remove intermediate files (e.g., `*.o` file) of the build process as well as backup files created by the editor but keep the final executable
* `clobber` - like clean, but additionally remove the final executable
* `archive` - like clobber, but additionally creates a ZIP archive `streaming_min_max_comparison.zip` containing all sources and the `Makefile`s.

## Running

The executable of the benchmarking framework (`streaming_min_max_comparison`) has the following synopsis:

    streaming_min_max_comparison [OPTIONS]
	
where `OPTIONS` may be one or multiple of the following:

* `-h`, `--help` - provide some usage information
* `-w`, `--window_size=WINDOW_SIZE` - define the size of the sliding windod for the streaming min/max algorithm in the range of [1, `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`]
* `-s`, `--sample_size=SAMPLE_SIZE` - define the number of samples (i.e., size of input vector) for the streaming min/max algorithm in the range of [1, `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`]
* `-i`, `--iterations=ITERATIONS` - define the number iterations (i.e., number of invocation of the `calc()` function of each algorithm) in the range of [1, `std::numeric_limits<int>::max()`]

If the executable was created via a debug build, the following additional option is supported:

* `-v`, `--verbose` - produce verbose tracing output on `stdout`
