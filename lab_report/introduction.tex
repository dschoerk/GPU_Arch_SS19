\section{Introduction and Problem Statement}

In the course of this lab, parallel versions of a sliding window minimum/maximum filter with configurable window size inspired by a sequential algorithm developed by Daniel Lemire~\cite{lemire2006streaming} and its reference implementation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/lemire/runningmaxmin}} had to be implemented.

The implementation was done using NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model for general computing on graphical processing units (GPUs) named CUDA\footnote{\url{https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/}}. Hereby different versions of the algorithm (with different degrees of optimization and parallelism) have been implemented using plain CUDA on the one hand and Thrust\footnote{\url{https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/thrust/index.html}} (NVIDIA's C++ template library for CUDA) on the other hand.
 
The source code for this project together with profiling screenshots and measurement data is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/dschoerk/GPU_Arch_SS19/}.
